# 🏗️ Module II Challenge

## Demo Portfolio

A non-fussy, light-hearted attempt at mastering the concepts. The actual content is not meant to be taken seriously. To be featured on this webpage :

* A demo "About Me" section.
* A demo "Works" section. 
* A demo "Contact" section.
* Header links will direct user to respective sections on the page.
* Webpage will have flex functionality in different screen sizes. 
* A format and aesthetic that is hopefully not too much of an eyesore.
